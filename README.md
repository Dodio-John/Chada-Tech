# Chada-Tech
Chada Tech clock project was solving an issue of having a 12hr and 24 hour clock format displayed on screen simultaneously. 
Also allowing users to change the clock with input.

In this project I believe I did well on the display menu portion, my user input handling worked well also.

I think I could enhance my code by making the clock tick or run and have that displaying to the user. Or possibly allowing
the user to set the time of the clocks opposed to just adding time.

I think the most challenging code to write in this project was the time formating for the 24 hour format.
Another challenging section of this code was the user handling. I overcame these challenges by going back
to the course reading.

The skills about converting the time and making an asthetic display menu will be useful in future coursework.

I used in line comments to make this program readable and adaptable, I tried to make a program that if another
programmer needed to make a change the comments could point them to the location of code they need to edit.
